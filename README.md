## Project Overview

This project, **livability**, leverages advanced web technologies and data analytics to provide a dynamic visualization of food deserts across Florida over time. Using MapboxGL, React, and Python, we've created an interactive tool that merges geoJson data with historical Florida census tract information, highlighting areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Visualization**: Plot food deserts on an interactive MapboxGL map.
- **Filtering by County**: Focus on specific counties to understand local challenges.
- **Demographic Insights**: Access detailed demographic information for each census tract within a county.

## Technologies & Libraries

- Frontend: React
- Mapping: MapboxGL
- Backend: Python
- Libraries: orjson, json, mapbox, pandas, geopandas
